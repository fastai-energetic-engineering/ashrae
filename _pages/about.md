Team Energetic Engineering was formed for the Queensland AI's FastAI course group project. We focus on tabular data analysis using the [ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/overview) dataset from Kaggle. We are a group of energetic learners comprising (in alphabetical order):
- Mikhael Manurung
- Oluwakayode Olamoyegun
- Owen Lamont
- Roger Butler

As part of our individual learning journeys, we each will be contributing notebooks in this site.
